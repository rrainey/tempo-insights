# Tempo Insights Web Application Architecture Plan

## Overview and Technology Stack  
Tempo Insights is a Next.js web application (TypeScript) running on a Raspberry Pi 5 (Ubuntu 24.04) designed for skydive jump log collection and analysis【11†L389-L397】. The app interfaces with **Tempo-BT** logging devices over Bluetooth and emphasizes minimal user intervention: a jumper simply powers on the device, makes a jump, and the system automatically discovers and uploads the jump log for later review【1†L2-L11】. Key technologies include the **Mantine** UI library for a dark-themed interface (using the provided color palette), **Recharts** for 2D charts, **D3** for interactive 3D skydive visualizations, **Prisma** as the ORM, and **Supabase (PostgreSQL)** as the database【11†L389-L397】. The app is deployed on-site at a drop zone to leverage local Bluetooth connectivity to devices【11†L398-L404】. 

**System Components:** The architecture consists of a Next.js server (serving pages and APIs) and two background Node.js processes for device communication and log analysis. A continuous **Bluetooth Discovery Service** runs as a separate process to scan for devices and handle log file uploads【9†L89-L98】【11†L478-L480】, while a scheduled **Log Analysis Worker** runs in parallel to process new jump logs and group formation skydives【9†L108-L116】【11†L442-L449】. The web application backend itself handles user interactions, API requests, and certain device management commands (like provisioning or blinking a device) by invoking Bluetooth functions on demand【11†L478-L480】. All components share a common data store (Supabase/Postgres) to communicate state and results. The entire UI is dark-mode only, styled via Mantine theming to use the specified color palette (e.g. `#002233` as primary background, `#ddff55` as emphasis)【11†L406-L415】【11†L482-L485】.
